# Shardbreak Gameplay Rules

## Core Loop

The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce balls upward and destroy blocks. When all blocks in a level are destroyed, the level is complete. If the player runs out of lives, it's game over.

## Lives

- The player starts with 3 lives.
- A life is lost only when all balls are gone — no balls remain on screen or locked to the paddle.
- If locked balls remain (stuck to the paddle), no life is lost.
- After losing a life, a new ball spawns locked to the paddle and the player must press Space to launch it.

## Ball

- The ball moves at a constant speed. Its velocity is renormalized every simulation step.
- The ball cannot travel near-horizontally — a minimum vertical speed is enforced.
- When launched from the paddle, the ball releases in the direction of the paddle surface normal at its lock position.
- The initial ball spawns offset from the paddle center (not dead center) to avoid launching straight up.

### Ball Locking (Sticky Paddle)

- When the StickyPaddle effect is active and a ball hits the paddle, the ball locks to the paddle at the contact point.
- Locked balls follow the paddle's movement with a fixed offset.
- The player can press Space at any time to release all locked balls.
- When the StickyPaddle effect expires, all locked balls are automatically released.
- Multiple balls can be locked simultaneously.

## Paddle

- The paddle has a curved bow-shaped top surface (parabolic arc).
- Ball bounce direction depends on where the ball hits the paddle — hits near the edges produce steeper angles, hits near the center produce more vertical bounces.
- The maximum bounce angle is 67.5 degrees from vertical.
- The paddle is clamped within the playing area boundaries.

### Paddle Collision

- A ball can only bounce off the paddle when moving downward.
- After a paddle bounce, the ball's vertical velocity is forced upward to prevent multi-bounce issues.

## Blocks

- Blocks have a lives count. Each hit reduces lives by 1.
- When a block's lives reach 0, it is destroyed.
- Each ball tracks a hit streak counter that starts at 0 and increments with each block hit.
- Block hit score = 100 + 10 × hit streak (first hit = 100, second = 110, third = 120, etc.).
- The hit streak resets to 0 when the ball bounces off the paddle.
- Only one block collision is processed per ball per simulation step.
- Destroyed blocks may drop an item (25% chance).

## Items

Items are small colored squares that fall downward after a block is destroyed. The player catches them by touching them with the paddle.

### Item Types

| Item | Duration | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Extra Life | Instant | Gain 1 life |
| Extra Ball | Timed (15s) | Spawn a duplicate of ball 0 with mirrored horizontal velocity |
| Wide Paddle | Timed (10s) | Paddle width increased by 50% |
| Narrow Paddle | Timed (8s) | Paddle width reduced to 70% |
| Sticky Paddle | Timed (12s) | Balls stick to paddle on contact |

- Multiple effects can stack (e.g. Wide + Narrow apply simultaneously).
- Items that fall below the playing area are removed.
- Item drops are random — the item type is chosen uniformly from all types.
- Maximum 16 active item drops on screen at once.
- Maximum 8 active effects at once.

## Walls

- The ball bounces off the left, right, and top walls of the playing area.
- The bottom of the playing area is open — balls that fall below are lost.

## Level Progression

- When all blocks are destroyed, the level is complete.
- The player advances to the next level with their current score and lives preserved.
- Each level can define its own block layout and playing area width.
- If the player completes all available levels, the game returns to the main menu.

## Screens and Transitions

- **Main Menu**: Start Game, Options, Quit.
- **Playing (WaitingToStart)**: Overlay shown at the start of each life. Any key press dismissed it; Space launches the ball.
- **Playing (Active)**: Normal gameplay. Escape/P pauses.
- **Playing (Paused)**: Resume or Quit to menu.
- **Level Complete**: Press Space/Enter to advance, Escape to return to menu.
- **Game Over**: Press Enter/Escape to return to menu. Space does NOT dismiss this screen (prevents accidental skip).

## Simulation

- Physics runs on a fixed timestep (10ms per step).
- Simulation pauses during non-Active playing states (Paused, WaitingToStart) and non-Playing screens (menus, game over, level complete).
